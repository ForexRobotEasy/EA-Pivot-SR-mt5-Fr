## Code Overview

The code for EA Pivot SR MT5 FR is written in MQL5 language and is designed to implement the Pivot Point System strategy. The strategy calculates pivot levels, resistance levels, and support levels based on the previous candle's high, low, and close prices. It then places pending orders at these calculated levels.

The code includes the following key components:

1. Input Parameters: The code allows the user to set the time for order placement in GMT using the `OrderPlacementTime` input parameter.

2. Pivot Point System Function: The `PivotPointSystem()` function calculates pivot levels, resistance levels, and support levels based on the previous candle's high, low, and close prices. It then places pending orders at these calculated levels.

3. Order Placement: The code checks if the current hour is equal to the specified `OrderPlacementTime`. If true, it places two pending orders: a buy stop order and a sell stop order. The parameters for these orders, such as price, stop loss, and take profit, are calculated based on the calculated levels.

4. Expert Advisor Initialization: The `OnInit()` function initializes the expert advisor by enabling the necessary technical indicators and allocating buffers.

5. Expert Advisor Start: The `OnTick()` function is the entry point for the expert advisor. It calls the `PivotPointSystem()` function to perform the Pivot Point System strategy.
